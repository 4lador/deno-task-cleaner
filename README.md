A handy shell script for Deno projects...

- Kill duplicate task instances in monorepos.
- Filter out any unwanted text from stderr using `grep`, including but not limited to `compilerOptions` and `importMap` warnings.
- Ensure a clean development environment with Deno tasks.

Ideal for **Deno projects**, especially those using **Fresh with custom configurations like monorepos** or any Deno process that needs **stderr filtering**.

## Features
- Dynamic task handling: Specify the task name as an argument.
- Prevents duplicate task instances (`pgrep` + `kill`).
- Filters unwanted warnings in real-time (`tail -f` + `grep`).
- Compatible with bash, zsh, and fish shells.
